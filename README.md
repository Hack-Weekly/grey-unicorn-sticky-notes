# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Sprint Planning (Day 1):

Define the goals and objectives of the sticky note app.
Break down the project into user stories and tasks.
Estimate the effort required for each task.
Prioritize the user stories based on importance and dependencies.
Assign tasks to team members based on skills and availability.
Backend Development (Days 2-4):

Set up the development environment, including version control and project structure.
Create the necessary models and database schema for sticky notes.
Implement user authentication and authorization using a suitable framework (e.g., Devise).
Build the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for sticky notes.
Write tests to ensure the functionality is working as expected.
Conduct code reviews to maintain code quality.
Frontend Development (Days 5-9):

Design the user interface and user experience (UI/UX) for the sticky note app.
Develop the frontend components and views using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Implement the necessary frontend frameworks or libraries (e.g., React, Vue.js) if desired.
Integrate the frontend with the backend API to fetch and update sticky notes.
Implement responsive design and ensure cross-browser compatibility.
Write tests for frontend components and perform thorough testing.
Integration and Testing (Days 10-11):

Integrate the frontend and backend components.
Conduct end-to-end testing to ensure the app functions correctly as a whole.
Perform user acceptance testing to validate the app against the initial goals and requirements.
Identify and fix any bugs or issues found during testing.
Optimize performance and address any security concerns.
Documentation and Deployment (Days 12-13):

Prepare necessary documentation, including user guides or API documentation.
Review and update README files and installation instructions.
Set up a deployment environment (e.g., cloud hosting platform, server configuration).
Deploy the app to the chosen environment, ensuring all dependencies are installed.
Perform final testing on the deployed app to confirm it functions correctly.
Sprint Review and Retrospective (Day 14):

Conduct a sprint review meeting to demonstrate the completed sticky note app.
Collect feedback from stakeholders and users.
Hold a retrospective meeting with the development team to discuss successes and areas for improvement.
Document lessons learned and identify action items for future sprints or projects.
